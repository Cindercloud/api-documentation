The Cindercloud SDK is free of use, but as some features require quite some resources, we've implemented a fair-use pricing model.

Visit [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/Qkyrie/api/cindercloud) to see our pricing model. 

Our free tier will always remain free and is only rate-limited, not feature-limited.
